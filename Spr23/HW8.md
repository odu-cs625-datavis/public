# Homework 8: Project - Implement Final Chart

**Due:** Thursday, April 20, 2023 by 11:59pm

HWs 6-8 are the final assignments of the semester and will build up to a final visualization.  The end goal is to produce a static *explanatory* visualization that reveals some interesting relationship between two datasets. The table below provides an overview of the three assignments.

|assignment|main tasks|due date|
|---|---|---|
|HW 6|choose your main dataset, start the EDA process|Thur, March 30|
|HW 7|gather the 2nd dataset, generate specific questions, sketch proposed charts|Tue, April 13|
|HW 8|fully develop the final chart|Thur, April 20|

I strongly encourage you to discuss your topic, datasets, questions, and proposed charts with me well in advance of the deadlines. I want to give you feedback as you work through this process. 

## Assignment

Use principles from data journalism/storytelling to refine **one of your proposed charts** from HW7.  You must include a headline that summarizes the main point of your chart (as opposed to a title that only describes your chart) and appropriate axis labels. You also should include annotations or context as needed.  This will be your final chart, so care should be taken in choosing fonts, colors, and other design/aesthetic aspects.

You may use any tool of your choice to complete this assignment. (But be particularly careful about using Tableau as it may not as easily customizable as the other options, and customization is a large part of this assignment.)

### Demo Video

For this final assignment, create a short demo video where you walk through and explain your final visualization. You should point out the question you are addressing and how the visualization idiom you chose helps to answer the question.  Point out interesting aspects of your visualization and mention any parts that you are particularly proud of (for example, if there was something difficult that you figured out how to implement).  This demo video should be at most 5 minutes long and will be shared with your classmates (see [Submission](#submission) for instructions).

*By Saturday, April 22 at 11:59pm, you must have provided some positive, constructive feedback or asked a question in at least one of your classmate's video threads.*

## Report

Your report for HW8 should be a stand-alone document and should not depend upon us reading your HW6 or HW7 reports, so you may want to copy over elements from your HW6 and HW7 reports for this assignment.

As always, I expect your report to include your name, CS625-HW8, date, and appropriate headings and Markdown markup for clarity and neatness. You will lose points if there are many spelling or grammatical errors. 

Your report should include the following information:
* a brief description of your chosen datasets  (including links to the original sources of the data)
* final question from HW7 that you will be addressing
* image of your selected draft chart from HW7 (this should be one that you submitted in HW7)
* image of your refined chart
* explanation of how your final chart answers the question you asked in HW7 and how your headline fits your chart
* description of all design decisions made in transforming from the draft to the refined chart 
    * every element on your chart should be explained and justified in your report
* discuss the visualization principles from the semester that were incorporated into the final visualization
* "Final Thoughts" section that provides a commentary on the development process, including roughly how much time you spent developing your visualization and what aspects took the most time. I'd also like some feedback on if splitting this up into 3 separate assignments instead of 1 big project assignment was helpful or not.

As always, you must include a section titled "References", including links to any examples and references that you used in completing this assignment.

## Submission
Make sure that you have committed and pushed your local repo to GitHub.   *Your repo should include all resources used to complete the assignment.  Links to outside notebooks should be included and documented in your report.* Include "Ready to grade @Faryaneh @saumyadabhi" in your final commit message. 

Submit the URL of your report in Canvas:
* Click on HW8 under Assignments in Canvas
* Under "Assignment Submission", click the "Write Submission" button.
* Copy/paste the URL of your `report.md` file into the edit box (should be something like https<nolink>://github.com/odu-cs625-datavis/spring23-hw8-*username*/blob/master/report.md)
* Make sure to "Submit" your assignment.

 Submit the URL of your demo video in the Canvas Discussion Forum "HW8 Demo Videos".  Create a new thread and use the topic of your visualization as the Subject.  In your post, note if the video is publicly available (e.g., via YouTube) or if it requires an ODU login (e.g., ODU Zoom video published via Kaltura or in ODU OneDrive).
