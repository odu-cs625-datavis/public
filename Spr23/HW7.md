# Homework 7: Project - Generate In-depth Questions Using EDA
 
**Due:** Tuesday, April 13, 2023 by 11:59pm

HWs 6-8 are the final assignments of the semester and will build up to a final visualization.  The end goal is to produce a static *explanatory* visualization that reveals some interesting relationship between two datasets. The table below provides an overview of the three assignments.

|assignment|main tasks|due date|
|---|---|---|
|HW 6|choose your main dataset, start the EDA process|Thur, March 30|
|HW 7|gather the 2nd dataset, generate specific questions, sketch proposed charts|Tue, April 13|
|HW 8|fully develop the final chart|Thur, April 20|

I strongly encourage you to discuss your topic, datasets, questions, and proposed charts with me well in advance of the deadlines. I want to give you feedback as you work through this process. 

## Assignment

Continue the EDA process that you started in HW6.  Identify and gather the 2nd dataset needed to address the questions you developed in HW6.  Starting with the questions you developed in HW6, continue the EDA process to further explore the combination of the two datasets. 

Generate **2 interesting questions** that could be answered via visualization using your 2 datasets.  *If you keep the same questions that you produced in HW6, you must thoroughly justify this decision.*  (Note that if you have chosen datasets and questions that are too similar to another student's, I may ask you to adjust your questions. This is another reason to talk with me early about your ideas.)

In your report, describe your EDA process. Talk about how you moved from initial questions from HW6 to the final questions that you submit.  You may generate overview or distribution charts as you work through the EDA process. Your report should describe any data manipulation and include any analysis charts that you developed as part of this EDA process. You may use any tool of your choice.

In addition, sketch (on paper) or draft (using the tool of your choice) **at least 2 potential charts that could address each of your 2 questions**.  The charts for the same question should be different idioms to allow you to evaluate which will end up being the most effective representation.

## Report

Your report for HW7 should be a stand-alone document and should not depend upon us reading your HW6 report, so you may want to copy over elements from your HW6 report for this assignment.

As always, I expect your report to include your name, CS625-HW7, date, and appropriate headings and Markdown markup for clarity and neatness. You will lose points if there are many spelling or grammatical errors. 

Your report should contain the following information:
* description of your datasets (including links to the original sources of the data)
* description of your EDA process - start with your questions from HW6, describe/include any statistics or charts created to further explore the data, and describe how you generated additional questions
* final detailed questions that you arrived at
* images of your sketch or draft charts
* explanations of the charts and how they could be used to answer the detailed questions

As always, you must include a section titled "References", including links to any examples or references that you used in completing this assignment.

## Submission
Make sure that you have committed and pushed your local repo to GitHub.  *Your repo should include all resources used to complete the assignment.  Links to outside notebooks should be included and documented in your report.* Include "Ready to grade @Faryaneh @saumyadabhi" in your final commit message. 

Submit the URL of your report in Canvas:
* Click on HW7 under Assignments in Canvas
* Under "Assignment Submission", click the "Write Submission" button.
* Copy/paste the URL of your `report.md` file into the edit box (should be something like https<nolink>://github.com/odu-cs625-datavis/spring23-hw7-*username*/blob/master/report.md)
* Make sure to "Submit" your assignment.
