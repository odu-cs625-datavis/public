## Git, GitHub

1. *What is your GitHub username?*
    **rbacc001**

2. *What is the URL of your remote GitHub repo (created through Mr. Kennedy's exercises)?*

## R

The command below will load the tidyverse package.  If you have installed R, RStudio, and the tidyverse package, it should display a list of loaded packages and their versions.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## R Markdown 

1. *Create a bulleted list with at least 3 items*
  ##   item 1: mango
  ## item 2: apple
  ## item 3: grapes
 
2. *Write a single paragraph that demonstrates the use of italics, bold, bold italics, code, and includes a link. The paragraph does not have to make sense.*
    *My name is Ramesh*.
    # I am from India
    # *I have taken computer science course*
    ```		{r, echo = FALSE}
		numericInput("n","How many cars?", 5)
		renderTable({head(cars, input$n)
		})
     ```

#### Data Visualization Exercises

1. (Q2) *How many rows are in mpg? How many columns?*
      # *There are 234 rows and 11 columns in mpg
1. (Q4) *Make a scatterplot of hwy vs cyl.*
      # ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

#### Workflow: basics Exercises

1. (Q2) *Tweak each of the following R commands so that they run correctly (`library(tidyverse)` is correct):*

```r
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(dota = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

fliter(mpg, cyl = 8)

filter(diamond, carat > 3)
```

# library(tidyverse) is corrext

# ggplot(dota = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) is wrong
 ## correct answer is ggplot(data = mpg) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

# fliter(mpg, cyl = 8) is wrong
 ## correct answer is filter(mpg, cyl = 8)

# filter(diamond, carat > 3) is wrong since there are no object defined as diamond in data.
 ## correct answer is 
## Google Colab

1. *What are the URLs of your Google Colab notebooks (both Python and R)?*
   # url for google colab python and R Notebook
    # https://drive.google.com/drive/search?q=owner:me%20(type:application/vnd.google.colaboratory%20||%20type:application/vnd.google.colab)
   # changes done in google colab in python file https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PgeZcluBEflSWSi6H_1eh9FaOnTLROps?usp=sharing

## Tableau

*Insert your the image of your final bar chart here*
# ![an image caption Source: SalesintheEastHW1](https://github.com/odu-cs625-datavis/spring23-hw1-rbacc001/blob/master/SalesintheEastHW1.png))

1. *What conclusions can you draw from the chart?*
    # In the chart we can see the sales vs profit per year. As the year increases the profit also increases especially for storage and technology. There is also a high       demand in furniture. This only covers East part of the region.
## Observable and Vega-Lite

### A Taste of Observable

1. *In the "New York City weather forecast" section, try replacing `Forecast: detailedForecast` with `Forecast: shortForecast`. Then press the blue play button  or use Shift-Return to run your change. What happens?*
 # Then it only shows some minor details.

1. *Under the scatterplot of temperature vs. name, try replacing `markCircle()` with `markSquare()`. Then press the blue play button  or use Shift-Return to run your change. What happens? How about `markPoint()`?*
 # if we change 'markCircle()' to 'markSquare()' then the plot of circles changes to square. Similarly if we change to 'markPoint()' then plot changes to hallow circles.

1. *Under "Pick a location, see the weather forecast", pick a location on the map.  Where was the point you picked near?*
# Longitude: -119.36     latitude: 35.62

1. *The last visualization on this page is a "fancy" weather chart embedded from another notebook.  Click on the 3 dots next to that chart and choose 'Download PNG'.  Insert the PNG into your report.*

### Charting with Vega-Lite

`markCircle()`

1. *Pass an option of `{ size: 200 }` to `markCircle()`.*
 # Size increased to 200
3. *Try `markSquare` instead of `markCircle`.*
 # The dots have changed to square
5. *Try `markPoint({ shape: 'diamond' })`.*
`vl.x().fieldQ("Horsepower")`, ...

1. *Change `Horsepower` to `Acceleration`*
 # axis are changed
3. *Swap what fields are displayed on the x- and y-axis*
# 
`vl.tooltip().fieldN("Name")`

1. *Change `Name` to `Origin`.*
 # If we use Name then all the car name can be seen and if we replace/change with Origin then we only see the country name where the cars are manufactured/came.
Another example, `count()`

1. *Remove the `vl.y().fieldN("Origin")` line.*
 # count of records on X-Axis is displayed
3. *Replace `count()` with `average("Miles_per_Gallon")`.*
 # Values are changed on X-Axis
