# Homework 3: Re-create Charts

**Due:** Thursday, February 16, 2023 by 11:59pm

## Assignment

The goal of this assignment is to give you experience with multiple visualization tools by re-creating two existing charts as closely as possible. This includes colors, fonts, and any text elements. For each chart, there's an article describing the chart (most are re-makes of other charts) and an Excel data file.

Choose one chart from Part 1 and one chart from Part 2.  The two charts you re-create must use different idioms *and* must be created using different tools. *Extra credit will be given for excellent re-creations that use R or Vega-Lite.*

### Part 1 - Choose one chart, can use Excel, Tableau, R, or Vega-Lite

#### Line chart #1

Note: In this image, the groceries category has been mistakenly swapped with electronics/hobbies.  You can either create this exact chart or you can create the correct version. Just note which you've done in your report.

## Report

Your report is an important part of this assignment. It is not sufficient to only include the re-created images.

For each part, your report must include the following items:
* image and link to the original chart (*must be inserted into the report, see how I included and resized the images in the assignment description for an example*)
* image of your re-created chart
* description of how you created the chart in the tool of your choice (*include enough detail to help someone trying to re-create your chart*)
* assessment of how close you were able to re-create each chart (*what things were you not able to re-create?*)
* assessment of the tool you used and how flexible it was in terms of being able to re-create the chart
* explain how the idiom choice is appropriate for the data and the task

If you use an online tool (Tableau online or Vega-Lite in an Observable notebook), provide a link in your report.

Remember that your report must include a References section that lists resources you consulted.  It's ok to find things online for inspiration, but make sure that you're not just wholesale copying something you've found online.

**Formatting:** I expect your report to include your name, CS625-HW3, date, and appropriate headings and Markdown markup for clarity and neatness. In addition, you will lose points if there are many spelling or grammatical errors. If you are not using R, then you can write the report in regular Markdown and skip the Knit process.

## Files to Include

Include in your repo any source files used to create your charts.  This includes any images, Tableau workbooks, Excel files, or R source (though this may be included as runnable code in your report.Rmd).

## Submission
Make sure that you have committed and pushed your local repo to GitHub.  Include "Ready to grade @Faryaneh  @saumyadabhi" in your final commit message. 

Submit the URL of your report (*not the URL of your repo*) in Canvas:
* Click on HW3 under Assignments in Canvas
* Under "Assignment Submission", click the "Write Submission" button.
* Copy/paste the URL of your `report.md` file into the edit box (should be something like https<nolink>://github.com/odu-cs625-datavis/fall22-hw3-*username*/blob/master/report.md)
* Make sure to "Submit" your assignment.
