## Chapter 7 - Arrange Tables

* Explain why the arrange design choice is the most crucial visual encoding choice.
* Explain how the concepts of express, separate, order, and align all relate to arranging tabular data.
* For each idiom example in the text (from scatterplot to normalized stacked bar chart), identify the "what: data" properties of the idiom.
* For each idiom example in the text, identify the "how: encode" properties of the idiom.
* For each idiom example in the text, identify the "why: task" properties of the idiom.
* For each idiom example in the text, identify the "scale" properties of the idiom.
* Differentiate between line charts and bar charts and explain when each is appropriate
* Explain some of the disadvantages of pie charts.
* Explain how a radial layout maps to a rectilinear layout.
* Given a particular dataset and task, suggest an idiom and explain why it might be appropriate
* Identify a visualization where an inappropriate arrange design choice was made and explain why the choice was inappropriate.

## Chapter 10 - Map Color and Other Channels

* Describe the components of color.
* Describe the three main types of colormaps.
* Explain the importance choosing an appropriate colormap.
* Given a set of data and a task, determine an appropriate colormap.
* Identify an inappropriate use of a colormap and suggest a more appropriate one.
* Explain why rainbow colormaps should only be used with great care.
* For the visual channels other than color, identify which are magnitude and which are identity channels.

## Chapter 8 - Maps (8.1-8.3)

* Describe how the arrange design choice is different with spatial data as opposed to tabular data.
* Describe a choropleth map.

## Chapter 6 - Rules of Thumb

* Explain potential difficulties with the use of 3D visualization.
* Identify situations in which the use of 3D visualization would be appropriate.
* Explain why "eyes beat memory".
* Explain what happens when people experience cognitive load.
* Define change blindness.
* Explain the tradeoff between resolution and immersion.
* Explain the Shneiderman mantra "overview first, zoom and filter, details on demand".
* Explain the alternate concept of "search, show context, expand on demand" and identify in what situations it may be more appropriate than the Shneiderman mantra.
* Explain the importance of the design slogan "get it right in black and white".

## Chapter 13 (through 13.4.1) - Reduce Items and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Explain the need to reduce data, both in terms of number of items and number of attributes.

* Identify instances of scented widgets, as opposed to standard filtering widgets.
* Contrast histograms with bar charts.
* Explain the importance of binwidth in a histogram.
* Describe the components of a boxplot.
* List the three steps in the iterative cycle of EDA.
* Explain the concept of covariation.
* Name some questions to ask about patterns found in data.
* Given a dataset, generate questions aimed at examining correlation and understanding underlying patterns in the data.

## Storytelling

* List the seven genres of narrative visualization.
* Describe the Martini glass structure of narrative visualization.
* Describe a stepper in an interactive visualization.
