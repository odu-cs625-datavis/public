# Homework 4: Re-create Charts

**Due:** Tuesday, October 20, 2020 by 11:59pm

## Assignment

The goal of this assignment is to re-create two existing charts as closely as possible. This includes colors, fonts, and any text elements. The data files and a link to the image of the original chart are provided.

Choose one chart from Part 1 and one chart from Part 2.  The two charts you re-create must use different idioms *and* must be created using different tools. *Extra credit will be given for excellent recreations that use R or Vega-Lite.*

### Part 1 - Choose Excel, Tableau, R, or Vega-Lite

## Report

Your report is an important part of this assignment. It is not sufficient to only include the re-created images.

For each part, your report must include the following items:
* link to the original chart
* image of your re-created chart (*this must be inserted into the report, not just a link*)
    * to resize the image, you can use standard HTML (e.g., `<img src="file.png" height="200"/>`)
* description of how you created the chart in the tool of your choice (*include enough detail to help someone trying to re-create your chart*)
* an assessment of how close you were able to re-create each chart (*what things were you not able to re-create?*)
* an assessment of the tool you used and how flexible it was in terms of being able to re-create the chart

If you use an online tool (Tableau online or Vega-Lite in an Observable notebook), provide a link in your report.

**Formatting:** I expect your report to include your name, CS625-HW4, date, and appropriate headings and Markdown markup for clarity and neatness. In addition, you will lose points if there are many spelling or grammatical errors. 

## Files to Include

Include in your repo any source files used to create your charts.  This includes any Tableau workbooks, Excel files, or R source (though this may be included as runnable code in your report.Rmd).

## Submission
Make sure that you have committed and pushed your local repo to GitHub.  Include "Ready to grade @weiglemc" in your final commit message. 

Submit the URL of your report (*not the URL of your repo*) in Blackboard:
* Click on HW4 under Assignments in Blackboard
* Under "Assignment Submission", click the "Write Submission" button.
* Copy/paste the URL of your `report.md` file into the edit box (should be something like https<nolink>://github.com/cs625-datavis-fall20/hw4-recreate-*username*/blob/master/report.md)
* Make sure to "Submit" your assignment.
